# BetterDB Inc. Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") v1.0

Thank you for your interest in contributing to BetterDB Inc. ("BetterDB"). In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, BetterDB must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been agreed to by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below.

This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of BetterDB and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to BetterDB. Except for the license granted herein to BetterDB and recipients of software distributed by BetterDB, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

## 1. Definitions

**"You" (or "Your")** shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with BetterDB. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.

**"Contribution"** shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to BetterDB for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by BetterDB (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, **"submitted"** means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to BetterDB or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, BetterDB for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to BetterDB and to recipients of software distributed by BetterDB a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works. This includes the right to use Your Contributions under any license, including proprietary licenses.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to BetterDB and to recipients of software distributed by BetterDB a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) were submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 4. Representations

You represent that:

(a) You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to BetterDB, or that Your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with BetterDB.

(b) Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to BetterDB separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]."

(c) Your Contribution does not include any code licensed under the GNU General Public License, Lesser General Public License, Affero General Public License, or any other "copyleft" license that would require BetterDB to distribute source code of its proprietary software.

## 5. Support

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an **"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND**, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## 6. Notification

You agree to notify BetterDB of any facts or circumstances of which You become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
